                        Hey there! I'm Siddhant Bhalinge, the Founder and CEO of Ray and I'd love to share our story with you. <br /><br />
                        It's a story of passion, perseverance, and a deep love for nature that's been passed down in my family for three generations.

                        Our story began with Namdeo Umaji â€” the oldest seed company in India, founded by my great-grandfather in 1885. <br /><br />
                        As a young boy, I spent my days in his Byculla shop, surrounded by the promise of life contained in tiny seeds.
                        Those formative years really were the stepping stones of Ray's own journey.
